Hello! I am a fourth-year Bioengineering PhD student at the University of Washington. My research bridges between experimental and computational neuroscience: I design and run experiments to learn about the brain, and build computational models from that data to explain and learn about neural mechanisms. If interested in learning more about the specific projects I'm working on, please check out the "Projects" section.

One of the things I hope to accomplish in my career is to improve trust and communication in science. I'm a firm believer that science should be fun and accessible for everyone. Communicating science in both an informative and engaging way is non-optional in order to rebuild trust and equip the public with critical thinking skills needed for science, policy, and beyond. 

In my free time, I'm a [photographer](https://samanthasun.myportfolio.com/) and avid hiker- my 2021 goal is to hike 100 miles. I am a coffee addict, I have a cat named [Anya](https://www.instagram.com/potato.cat.anya/), my quarantine hobby of choice is raising houseplants, and I'm [BTS ARMY](https://www.usbtsarmy.com/).
