Hello! My name is Samantha, and I'm interested in improving biosensors for health and wellness outcomes. I'm a recent UW PhD graduate, where my research bridged between experimental and computational neuroscience. I designed and ran experiments to learn more about how the brain responds to therapeutic electrical stimulation, and I built computational models to characterize those neural responses to inform next-generation stimulation therapies. If interested in learning more about my projects, please check out the "projects" page.

One of the things I hope to accomplish in my career is to improve trust and communication in science. I'm a firm believer that science should be fun and accessible for everyone. Communicating science in both an informative and engaging way is essential to promote trust and equip the public with critical thinking skills needed for science, policy, and beyond. I'm currently involved in [scientific outreach](/outreach/) and am a content adviser with the Pacific Science Center. 

In my free time, I run a small business as a [ceramicist](https://www.instagram.com/samsunspots/), and I enjoy spending time in the outdoors- in 2021 I reached my goal of hiking 100 miles and I've through-hiked the Enchantments twice. I'm also a hobbiest[photographer](https://samanthasun.myportfolio.com/), and I have a cat named [Anya](https://www.instagram.com/potato.cat.anya/).
