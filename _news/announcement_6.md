Attended the IEEE SMC conference in Prague and presented my paper, "Human intracortical responses to varying electrical stimulation conditions are separable in low-dimensional subspaces". I was awarded Best Student Paper from IEEE Brain and was a finalist for Best Paper from IEEE SMC! Looking forward to attending their conference next year in Maui ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
