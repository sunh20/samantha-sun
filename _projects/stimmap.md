Below is an interactive figure that displays all electrodes that are responsive to stimulation in an example subject. Click on any green electrode to view the stimulation channels that activate this region. Click on the green electrode again or press the "R" button to return to the default view. 

*This work contributes to creating responsive stimulation maps for use in neuromodulation therapies. A paper detailing our analysis and methods is in preparation. Figma prototype was developed in collaboration with Jared Lai.*
